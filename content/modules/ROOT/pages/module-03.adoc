= Run a network restore automation job

== Lab 1

*Running a network restore job*

=== Challenge 3 - Running the restore automation job

This challenge will walk you through using Automation controller to execute the restore job you created on the 1st challenge.

Please click the Green Start button image:https://github.com/IPvSean/pictures_for_github/blob/master/start_button.png?raw=true[width=100px,align=left] on the bottom right corner if it did not already start provisioning.


=== How it works

. Network operator will execute the `Network Automation - Backup` job like we did in the last challenge
. The automation job will retrieve the configuration from the Cisco IOS router.
. The automation job will then store it on a specified `backup-server`
. Finally, The automation job will automatically create the `Network Automation - Restore` Job Template and populate all available backups for a Network Operator to choose via a Survey

We can actually automate Automation controller with simple tasks using the `ansible.controller` Ansible Collection.

=== Surveys

Surveys set extra variables for the playbook similar to 'Prompt for Extra Variables' does, but in a user-friendly question and answer way. Surveys also allow for validation of user input.
