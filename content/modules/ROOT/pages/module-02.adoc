= Run a network backup automation job

Learning to run a job in automation controller


== Challenge 2 - Running the backup automation job

* This challenge will walk you through using Automation controller to execute the backup job you created on the 1st challenge.


== Ansible Collections

* Ansible provides automation content in the form of collections.  An Ansible Collection contains modules, plugins and roles that a network engineer can use to build and customize their automation.
+
If you need a quick primer on what an Ansible Collection is, please refer to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOcqhk7TdYc&t=69s[YouTube Video here].

== The Cisco IOS collection

* For this demonstration we are going to automate against a Cisco IOS-XE router.  We need to use the Cisco IOS collection.
+
The FQCN (or fully qualified collection name) to use a module is: `namespace.collection.module`
+
So for our example it is: `cisco.ios.<module name>`

+
The task is this simple:
+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: backup cisco ios configuration
  cisco.ios.config:
    backup: true
  register: config_output
----

== Lets get started

That is the end of of your lab briefing!

// Once the lab is setup you can click the Green start button image:https://github.com/IPvSean/pictures_for_github/blob/master/start_button.png?raw=true[width=100px,align=left] in the bottom right corner of this window.

For this exercise we are going to run the automation job on Automation controller

=== Login to automation controller

* To login to automation controller select the `Automation controller WebUI` tab at the top of your screen.
+
Login with the following credentials:

=== Step 2 - Optional - Verify Backup

* In the Visual Studio Code tab you can open the backup configuration.  Open the `/backup` directory with Visual Studio Code and navigate to the most recent timestamp.  If you have executed the job more than one time you will have multiple options.  Open the `cisco.txt` file to reveal the Cisco IOS-XE running configuration.

=== Step 3 - Verify

Click the Next button below to verify the job executed.
