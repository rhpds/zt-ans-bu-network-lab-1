= Create a backup automation job template

Learn how to create a backup job template in automation*

== Lab 1 - Config Backup and Restore

* This lab will walk you through using Automation controller to automate backup and restore the configuration of a Cisco CSR (cloud services router) running IOS-XE.

// Please click the Green Start button image:https://github.com/IPvSean/pictures_for_github/blob/master/start_button.png?raw=true[width=100px,align=left] on the bottom right corner if it did not already start provisioning.

== Lab Diagram

* The lab diagram for this demonstration is very simple.  There will be one Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 device running automation controller.  It is directly connected to the management network for a Cisco CSR (cloud services router) running IOS-XE.

== Quick Automation Victories

* We know that network backup and restores are fairly uninteresting in the grand scheme of things, but they are a very common and ubiquitous use-case that all network operators will need. This provides an easy turn key use-case for network engineers to start their automation journey.

== Automation controller

* Automation controller provides a standardized way to define, operate, and delegate Ansible automation across the enterprise. It includes a Web User Interface (WebUI) that we will be using for this challenge.

== Job Templates

* Everything in Automation controller revolves around the concept of a *Job Template*.  Job Templates allow Ansible Playbooks to be controlled, delegated and scaled for an organization.
+
Job templates also encourage the reuse of Ansible Playbook content and collaboration between teams.
+
*A Job Template requires:*
+
** An *Inventory* to run the job against
** A *Credential* to login to devices.
** A *Project* which contains Ansible Playbooks

== Challenge 1 - Creating a backup Job Template

* For this challenge exercise you are going to create a Job Template in Automation controller.  We are going to use the Network Toolkit Collection (https://github.com/network-automation/toolkit) that contains multi-vendor playbooks for Backup, restore and more.

* The *credentials* (username and password), *inventory* (a single Cisco router) and *project* (the network toolkit repository listed above) are already added.  We simply need to tie them together into a simple re-usable Job Template for our organization to use.

== Lets get started

That is the end of of your lab briefing!

// Once the lab is setup you can click the Green start button image:https://github.com/IPvSean/pictures_for_github/blob/master/start_button.png?raw=true[width=100px,align=left] in the bottom right corner of this window.

For this exercise we are going to create an automation job on Automation controller

=== Login to automation controller

* To login to automation controller select the `Automation controller WebUI` tab at the top of your screen.
+
Login with the following credentials:
+
[%autowidth.stretch,width=70%,cols="^.^a,^.^a"]
|===
| username | admin
| password | ansible123!
|===

=== Step 1 - Create an automation job

* In the left navigation menu, expand *Automation Execution* and then click on *Templates*.

* You will see a list of *Job Templates*.  Job templates encourage the reuse of Ansible playbook content and collaboration between teams.

* Click the blue Add button and select *Create job template*

* Assign the following values
+
[%autowidth.stretch,width=70%,cols="^.^a,^.^a",options="header"]
|===
|Name                 | Value

|Name                 | Network Automation - Backup
|Job Type             | Run
|Inventory            | Network Inventory
|Project              | Network Toolkit
|Execution Environment|Default execution environment
|Playbook             | playbooks/network_backup.yml
|Credentials *NOTE:* there are two credentials
                      |   * Network Credential
                          * `AAP controller credential`
|===

+
IMPORTANT: To find the `AAP controller credential` change the *Selected Category* to `Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform`

* Click the *Create job template* button to save your job template.

=== Step 2 - Verify

Click the Next button below to verify the job template was created.
